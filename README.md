# dnvm

dnvm is the "dotnet version manager." This is a rethinking of the original dnvm project. This dnvm is a command-line interface for installing and updating different dotnet SDKs. It currently only supports installing user-local SDKs, as opposed to machine-wide.

```
usage: dnvm <command> [<args>]

    install    Install a new SDK
    update     Update the installed SDKs or dnvm itself
    list       List installed SDKs
    select     Select the active SDK directory
```
