# dnvm

dnvm is the "dotnet version manager." Dnvm is a command-line interface for installing and updating different dotnet SDKs.

## Getting started

dnvm installs .NET SDKs to the dnvm home path, which is `~/.local/dnvm` on Linux, ` ~/Library/Application\ Support/dnvm/` on Mac, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%/dnvm` on Windows. Dnvm lets you:
- Install the latest release from channels through the `track` command
- Update SDK versions through the `update` command
- Cleanup old SDKs through the `prune` command (see [detailed documentation](docs/prune.md))
- Install specific SDKs through the `install` command.

The `--help` command can help you find more information on all available commands.

## Channels

The simplest way to use dnvm is to track a channel. Channels are of two types: named channels and versions. Named channels are things like `latest`, `lts`, and `sts`. These correspond to the support status of various SDKs. For example, `lts` always corresponds to the currently supported .NET LTS SDK, while `latest` means the newest non-preview SDK in current support, LTS or STS.
